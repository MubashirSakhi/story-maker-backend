GraphQl Story Maker Backend

I was going through an article that mentions grapql is better than rest api as it allows you to return what is required and avoid extra redundant details thhat are not covered. 
While i had an idea of doing a very basic project which allows user to create titles and other users can develop their own stories around those titles and then users can rate and comment on the stories developed for a certain title. 
I followed graphql tutorial for nodejs but I tweaked it around my needs and added passport js to include social media oauth logins for the user to easily signup.
Next steps will be to use asycn await throughout the project and improve structure and understand subscription of graphql better.
